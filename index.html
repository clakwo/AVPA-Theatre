	<h2>The Best Academy at BCA filled with the best people you'll meet in you're life! We are theatre and theatre is life. Therefore, we are Life. According to the Transitive Property of Addition ;)</h2>

	<p id="friedchicken">This is an awesome place where you can find people with the same interests as you. You learn how to improve in your acting, your singing, and your dancing. You also get to learn a lot about how theater started and once in a while you will have a class where all you do is wear wigs and yell in Japanese. </p>

            <p>One thing that is important and awesome about the theatre academy at BCA is that you will get extremely close to the students in your theatre class. It is a relatively small class and you will all learn to come together and love each other through your 4 years together!</p>

    <div id="tab2" class="tab">
        <p>Theatre kids have "theatre families" that have been here since the beginning of AVPA/T classes. You're parent will be someone from the grade one above you, your grandparent will be 2 years above you, and great grandparent will be a senior in your time. Families can become extremely close and the love will radiate from your families. Families are awesome for support, advice, and just some extra love.</p>

        <p>Theatre teachers include Dr. Strum, Ms. Pero, Ms. Crochet, and Mr. Kaplan. These teachers are your lifeline and you will love them to death. Your classes with them will truly open your eyes to the amazing(and basically non-existent) boundaries of acting, theatre, and performing!</p>

    	<div id="tab4" class="tab">
        	<p>This is such an amazing place to go to school because coming here you will realize that you are not only smart, but talented and capable of doing great things. Just because your in theatre doesn't mean you can't enjoy other studies outside of theatre. It also doesn't mean you can't just do theatre because we will all love you anyways and accept you for who you really are. YOU DO YOU!</p>
